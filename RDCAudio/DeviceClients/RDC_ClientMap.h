//==================================================================================================
//	RDC_ClientMap
//
//  This class stores the clients (RDC_Client) that have been registered with RDCDevice by the HAL.
//  It also maintains maps from clients' PIDs and bundle IDs to the clients. When a client is
//  removed by the HAL we add it to a map of past clients to keep track of settings specific to that
//  client. (Currently only the client's volume.)
//
//  Since the maps are read from during IO, this class has to to be real-time safe when accessing
//  them. So each map has an identical "shadow" map, which we use to buffer updates.
//
//  To update the clients we lock the shadow maps, modify them, have RDC_TaskQueue's real-time
//  thread swap them with the main maps, and then repeat the modification to keep both sets of maps
//  identical. We have to swap the maps on a real-time thread so we can take the main maps' lock
//  without risking priority inversion, but this way the actual work doesn't need to be real-time
//  safe.
//
//  Methods that only read from the maps and are called on non-real-time threads will just read
//  from the shadow maps because it's easier.
//
//  Methods whose names end with "RT" and "NonRT" can only safely be called from real-time and
//  non-real-time threads respectively. (Methods with neither are most likely non-RT.)
