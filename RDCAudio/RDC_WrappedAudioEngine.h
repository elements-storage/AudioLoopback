//  The plan for this is to allow devices with IOAudioEngine drivers to be used as the output device
//  directly from RDCDriver, rather than going through RDCApp. That way we get roughly the same CPU
//  usage and latency as normal, and don't need to worry about pausing RDCApp's IO when no clients
//  are doing IO. It also lets RDCDriver mostly continue working without RDCApp running. I've written
//  a very experimental version that mostly works but the code needs a lot of clean up so I haven't
//  added it to this project yet.
